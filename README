laserhawk projects:

*** hoku2gdhe - This application scans a connected hokuyo sensor and displays
the data in a gdhe window.

*** hokuyomti - This application is currently used to read a hokuyo sensor and
to store the scan data in a log. Despite the name there is no use of the MTI,
so you should use another app to record MTI data (like MTIHardTest)

*** log2gdhe - This application reads the MTI and hokuyo scan logs and 
displays the data in a gdhe window. An included program mkvirtlog creates
virtual logs to validate proper operation.

*** ipks - openrobot libraries useful for gumstix overo development. These are built on a LAAS machine (borderouge) in openembedded.
