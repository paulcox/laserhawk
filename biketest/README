Steps to go from raw MTI and Hokuyo scans to animation:

1. get the MTI angles into the scan logs:
perl putangles.pl 2011-03-01-10-32-19
TODO: specify MTI filename

2. Create image directory

3. Run make animation

4. Process camera video : detect

Notes:

Detect angle from road surface (assuming it is level)
Detect angle from horizon in video

perl mods needed:
libstatistics-descriptive-perl
