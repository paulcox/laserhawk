biketest

This directory/project contains inertial/gps and laser scan logs from quick tests done with the 
sensors mounted on a bike-mounted boom. Video from a boom-mounted camera is also available (but
not in git due to size). Scripts in the script/ dir are used to produce an animated representation
of the data.

Test/Data Description
-------------------------
Name	Date	MTI Format	Description
-----	-----	----------	-----------
test1 - 030111	Euler
test2 - 030111	Euler
test3 - 030111	Euler		2 minute test travelling down road, taking 90 degree turn to right
  Test1-3 had MTI mounted upside down on boom, y-axis facing direction of travel

test4 - 030511	Euler		short test done at walking speed. straight line.
test5 - 030511	Euler		aproximately the reverse path of test6 done at walk speed.
test6 - 030511	Quaternion	Similar path as test 3
  Test4-6 had MTI mounted right-side up on boom, x axis facing direction of travel

DATA PROCESSING STEPS:

Steps to go from raw MTI and Hokuyo scans to animation:

1. get the MTI data into the scan logs :
	- For each scan log file, extacts the MTI line with closest time stamp and inserts it into scan log (first line)

	 ./putangles.pl 2011-03-01-10-32-19 MTI_log.out

2. Get maps and frames ready :
	- Downloads google map images for each second of the test
	- Extracts a video frame for each tenth of a second of the test

	 ./getmaps.pl 2011-03-01-10-32-19 MVI_0009.AVI

3. Generate plots
	- For each scan, creates a png image representing the scan data and inserts the map and video frame

	 ./plotlogs.pl 2011-03-01-10-32-19 1 10 1

4. Make animation
	- For requested scans, creates an animated gif from the pngs generated by plotlogs.pl

	 ./animatelogs.pl 2011-03-01-10-32-19 1 10 1
